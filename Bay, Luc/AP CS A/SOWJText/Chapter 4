Section 4.1
MC  1. A, decision structure
    2. D, boolean
    3. A, relation operators
    5. C, null statement
    6. D, braces
    7. A, flag
    8. B, A is less than B
    15. False
    16. True
    17. True
FTE 2. There is only one equal sign, not two
AW  1. if(y == 0)
	X = 100;
4. if(flag)
	Hours = 10;
SA 1. If it only executed if the condition is met
   2. The program will not think is it the end of a command so it will do the wrong thing
   3. So you know what is part of the if and what is not
   5. A flag variable is one of boolean that only stores true or false. 

Section 4.2
FTE 3. The program will print the last two lines no matter what because there are no braces
AW  2. if(y == 10)
		X = 0;
	Else
		X = 1;

Section 4.4
FTE 1. The last else if has to be an else. The conditional statements need an else
AW  3. if(sales > 10000)
		Rate = .1;
	Else if(sales < 15000)
		Rate = .2;
	Else
		Rate = .15;
SA 6. There is no default action if the conditions are not met

Section 4.5
MC 9. A, nested
   10. A, the closest previous if clause that doesn't already have its own else clause.
   18. True
   19. False
AW 5. if(amount1 > 10 && amount2 < 100)
	{
	if(amount1 > amount2)
		System.out.print(amount1);
	Else
		System.out.print(amount2);
	}
	
Section 4.6
MC  11. A, &&
FTE 5. The ! is in the wrong place, it must go before the <
    6. It has an or, not an and. Only one condition has to be met, not both
    7. It has an and, not an or. Both conditions must be met and that is impossible
AW  6. if(0 < grade < 100)
		System.out.print("The number is valid");
    7. if( -50 < temperature < 50)
	System.out.print("The number is valid");
    8. if( 0 > hours || 80 < hours)
	System.out.print("The number is not valid");
SA 7. Both of the conditions in an and statement must be met to return a true
   8. one of the conditions in an or statement must be met to return a true
