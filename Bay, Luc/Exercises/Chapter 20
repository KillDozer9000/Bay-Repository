R20.6 | I can draw on a white board if you want but not on this text document.

P20.3 | Reverse method in myLinkedList
P20.6 | Literally just the size variable in myLinkedList
P20.7 | removeLast and addLast in myLinkedList
P20.8 | ???

R20.8 | adding and removing elements is much easier, but it is harder to access elements
R20.9 | I would use an array so accessing the elements is easier. It would take much longer than with a list
R20.10| I would use a list so I can easily add and subtract events. There wont be many elements so an array would not be necessary.
